# responsive-jq-sample
An acquaintance asked for a *simple* responsive jQuery sample that showcased view state management (tabs-to-accordions), and history state management (with hashbangs, although deprecated).  This is what came of it.

Criteria :
- Use JQuery
- Build a responsive 'class="container"' div that'll hold a tab module
- Convert from tabs to accordion when window in portrait mode (or width < 480px)
- Build a back button friendly hash-bang-slash (i.e. "#!/") URL navigation system
